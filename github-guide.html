            <h2>Step 1: Create a new repository</h2>
            <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository"
                target="_blank">

                </p>
            </a>
            <p>
                Please avoid using an existing (non-empty) GitHub repository, as this may interfere with the app's
                file/folder management. Do not add any files to the repository after creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you finish creating the repository, please paste the http (not ssh) URL into Sepia Notes' settings.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2. Create a GitHub personal access token</h2>

                    Help
                    <img src='images/open.svg' />
                </p>
            </a>
            <p>
                Both a classic token, and a fine-grained token will work. However, you can't set fine-grained tokens to
                never expire, so you will have to re-create it at least once a year. Whichever token you choose, please
                ensure that Sepia Notes has the permission to fetch and push.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the case of the fine-grained token:
            </p>
            <img src='images/finegrained-token.webp'>
            <p>
                In the case of the classic token:
            </p>
            <img src='images/classic-token.webp'>
            <h2>Step 3. Copy the token into Sepia Notes settings</h2>
            <p>
                You can now copy and paste your token into Sepia Notes' settings, and press the "save" button. Please
                save a copy of this token if plan on using Sepia Notes on another device. Otherwise, you will have to
                create a new one.
