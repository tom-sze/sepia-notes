            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
                Although "we" is actually just me, I do try my best to keep the app bug-free, and introduce new features
                periodically.
                <br>
                Sepia Notes is a side project, which is (and will always be) unmonetized.
                I have designed the app to use as few server resources as possible, allowing the app to be completely
                free, in perpetuity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>
                The web app is built with the React javascript framework.
                <br>
                The built-in GitHub client is the only part of the app which requires a server connection. Although most
                git operations can be performed entirely in the browser, pushing requires the help of a server.
            </p>
